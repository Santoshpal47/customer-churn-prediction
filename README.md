## 🧠 Project Objective

Predict which telecom customers are most likely to churn and identify business drivers behind churn using:
- Logistic Regression
- SQL-based cohort analysis
- Visual insights through charts and distributions

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **SQL Queries** to extract high-risk customer cohorts
2. **EDA** with churn vs contract, tenure, charges
3. **Preprocessing**: Null handling, encoding, and feature setup
4. **Modeling**: Logistic Regression with 80%+ accuracy
5. **Insights**:
   - Churn is higher among month-to-month contract holders
   - Senior citizens show elevated churn risk
   - High monthly charges correlate with churn
